# JavaScript Quiz Game
This app required me to create a timed quiz game powered completely by JavaScript with high score data being stored locally. 

## App Breakdown
The quiz consists of an array of 10 question objects, each with 3 incorrect answers and 1 correct answer. The HTML elements are hidden and shown in logical order based on button clicks. The timer is intialized once the Start button is clicked, and 5 seconds is subtracted for each incorrect answer. If the question bank is depleted or the timer reaches 0, the current score is dislpayed. The user will be given a chance to enter their initials. When the user submits their initials, a high score table is displayed showing all of the local high scores. The user then has the option to clear the local high scores or restart the quiz.
